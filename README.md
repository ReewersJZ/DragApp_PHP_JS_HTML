### General info
The aim of the project was to create a web application that would  manage construction works. The application includes 2 types of access:
* for the construction team - entry and archiving of the thunder protection system construction works. Additionally, reporting the amount of used building materials;
* for the investor - downloading daily reports with the amount of used construction materials.
###### The application in this production version has been in use since November 2020. The earlier version was written in Python and it was a desktop application.

###### The motivation to write the application was the need to automate the work of a friendly company ordering the service. The application was created as a non-profit project.
